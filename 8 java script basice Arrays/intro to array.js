var friend1 = "sandeep";
var friend2 = "sunil"
var friend3 = "anil";
var friend4 = "Shivu"

// As we can see that there is a lot of repeated code (Not considered as DRY)

// rather than having 4 saperate variable , we can do it in one variable

var friends = ["sandeep", "sunil", "anil", "shivu"]
//here "sandeep" takes 0th place
