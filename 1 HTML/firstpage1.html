    <p>The 20-year-old continued to <b>impress</b> for Delhi and <i>attacks</i> , clearly demonstrating that he belonged at a much higher level;
         that junior cricket was beneath his standards. Kohli then traveled to Australia in 2009 for the Emerging players tournament and stamped his authority all over 
         the bowling attacks. He added 'big-match temperament' to his résumé too, lacing a fluent hundred in the final against South Africa, and guiding his team to a clinical victory. </p>
    <p>The young prodigy, barely old enough to receive his man-of-the-match champagne, ended the tournament with 398 runs from 7 outings with two centuries and two fifties, ensuring that he remained 
        fresh in the selectors' minds</p>
        <p>He is one of the highest rated cricet player with unbelivable records and scores </p>
