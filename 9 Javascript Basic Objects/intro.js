// in this session we are discussing objects 
// they are similar to the dictionaries in the python language

//ex 

var person = {name: "sandeep",

age : 21,
place : "Ghogga"}


// if u want to access the perticular part of the object  
// console.log(person.name)
// (or) console.log(person["name"]);








// if we want to replace something in the ibject, 

person["age"] += 1;
person["place"] = "humnabad"

// or it can be replace like
person.age = 23

//we have 2 options, use dot natation or square bracket notation
